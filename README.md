# Smart Compost System

Introduction
There is a drastic increase in waste generation which has become a big problem in managing it. Managing biodegradable waste is critical for reducing greenhouse gasses. Composting manually is a very tedious job, whereas there should be a mechanism that should measure components such as temperature which would be much easier. According to conditions, at regular intervals, the system should automatically rotate the fan and mix the compost. The system should also display the temperature, pH, and moisture levels on display and the buzzer should switch on when levels are not in optimum conditions.
